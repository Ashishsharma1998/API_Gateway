FRONTEND -- MIDDLE-END -- BACKEND

- we need an intermidate layer between client side and microservices.
- using this middleend, when client send a request, we will be able to make decision that which microservice should respond to this request.
- we can do message validation, response transformation, rate limiting.
- we try to prepare an API-GATEWAY to act like middle-end.
